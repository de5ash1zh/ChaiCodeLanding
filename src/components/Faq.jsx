      "ChaiCode is a live coding accountability cohort where learners commit to daily goals, join live sessions, and build projects in public with a community.",

    answer:
      "No worries â€” replays are shared, and you can catch up anytime. But consistency is ðŸ”‘ so we encourage showing up live!",
